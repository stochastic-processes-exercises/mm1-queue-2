#Â These are the parameters of the queue that you should use.  If you change the values
# of these parameters you will fail the test as I have set up the test this way.  In 
# writing your project you can change them but you should always ensure that lam<expr
lam, expr = 0.5, 1.0

# Use this to hold the times when the queue changes length as is discussed in the text
events = []
# Add code here to simulate the queue and to determine the distribution of lengths
